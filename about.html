                  <p class="about-description">Our Future of Change is the global, youth-led chapter of Her Future 
                      Coalition: an organization providing rehabilitation, education, and employment programs for trafficking 
                      survivors in India, Nepal, Cambodia, and Thailand. As the youth-chapter of this organization, Our Future of 
                      Change aims to provide students globally ages 13-22 with resources to get involved in the fight against human 
                      trafficking. Since initiation in May 2020, Our Future of Change has recruited a team of over 300 ambassadors 
                      in 30 countries who are actively working to raise awareness for trafficking in their communities. <br><br>
                      After joining Our Future of Change as an ambassador, students can join one of our volunteer committees 
                      or start a club in their school or community. We have a news, design, event planning, and outreach roles: 
                      all of which play a significant role in helping Our Future of Change to expand.</p>
