                <p>Lauren Bridgwater and Abigail Jones are the co-founders of OFOC. They began working in anti-trafficking activism during their 9th-grade year in high school by participating in their school’s Her Future Club which raises money to support the rehabilitation, education, and employment programs that Her Future Coalition offers survivors. During the break from school caused by COVID-19, they missed participating in their school’s Her Future Club and reached out to the Her Future Coalition leadership team to start a formal youth-chapter to unite more students around the world against trafficking. </p>

                <p>Abigail and Lauren founded this organization because there are so many people who know about the atrocities of human trafficking, but they don’t know how to help or make a difference. So many people believe that human trafficking is unpreventable. At OFOC, we want to change this mindset and so we have decided to spread awareness among students, who will be the future’s leaders. We have been working with Her Future Coalition for about 3 years now. We became the presidents of a Her Future Coalition Club at our school this past year and this past school year we donated about $3,000 to Her Future Coalition. This money helps support the education, employment, and rehabilitation programs that Her Future Coalition provides. It also helps support the shelters that Her Future Coalition has. Abigail and Lauren felt so impacted that they decided to found their own organization alongside Her Future Coalition in May, 2020. Hence, they started Our Future of Change as the youth chapter of HFC with the hopes to support trafficking survivors and high-risk children as well as educate students globally on how they can help prevent trafficking. </p>

                <p>Many people don’t realize that there is something we can all do to help prevent high-risk children from being trafficked and survivors from being trafficked again. Trafficking survivors are at high risk of being trafficked again as they have little to no education and are often impoverished. Hence, even after escaping a brothel, it is very difficult for them to find sustainable employment. We can all help prevent human trafficking by donating to Our Future of Change/Her Future Coalition (by donating to Our Future of Change, you are donating to Her Future Coalition. OFOC only has its own donation site to keep track of the funds that we have brought in). Donating to OFOC/HFC will go directly to supporting the shelters as well as the education, rehabilitation, and employment programs that HFC provides for survivors. Donating goes a long way:
                    $10 feeds a survivor for a week
                    $30 educates a survivor for a month
                    $50 shelters a survivor for a month
                    $360 educates a survivor for a year
                    $1,000 educates an entire classroom for a month
                    
                   The other way to prevent trafficking is to spread awareness about it. The more people that know about trafficking and how to prevent it, the more people that will donate and educate themselves. If all are ignorant to this global issue, then it will never end. Educating yourself is always of the utmost importance!</p>

                <p> Her Future Coalition is an organization providing rehabilitation, education, and employment programs to trafficking survivors in India, Nepal, Cambodia, and Thailand. It provides survivors with the resources necessary for them to earn a high wage and reintegrate into society so that they avoid being trafficked again. Her Future Coalition also provides shelter and education programs to high-risk youth who live in red-light areas where trafficking is heavily concentrated. Her Future Coalition was founded by Sarah Symons in 2005 and since has been able to provide opportunities for over 4,000 survivors and their families. Our Future of Change is the student-led chapter of Her Future Coalition. We collaborate with them when planning events, and 100% of our fundraising profits go to supporting them so that they may continue to provide resources for survivors to lead happy, fulfilling lives.</p>

                <p>100% of the profits donated to OFOC go to supporting Her Future Coalition so that they may continue to provide rehabilitation, education, and employment programs to trafficking survivors. OFOC receives monthly reports from the Her Future Coalition team describing how much was made and what that money was used to support. However, we can view donations at any time by visiting our campaign page.</p>
